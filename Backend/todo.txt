Fix none existing id's for relations

WHAT ABOUT IS-A?? Add INSERT INTO (block_type) (0/1) and foreign keys??

JOINs

native user str SQL support

fill/add new datas?? maybe with some rand() for introducing a random new data set with valid data

saving tmp to .db even if columns are swapped
=> now, should we swap the columns in INSERT INTO (column1, column2) ... AND then in the UI aswell because of the order saved in TMP
